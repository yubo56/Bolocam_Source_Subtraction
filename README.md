### Yubo's Source Subtraction IDL routines

Goal is to be able to both generate sky maps and to source subtract them across
multiple frequency bands. Included code does just that. Run help\_yubo for help
with arguments of various functions.

Documentation/coding style will probably be revised as merging into general kSZ
simulation
